Creating custom BLAST dbs via GUI

Requirements:
* [NCBI BLAST executables](http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download) must be installed and in the PATH
* environment variable BLASTDB must be set
* GUI is defined using [Enaml](https://github.com/nucleic/enaml), so this has to be installed as well
